Converting Magazines from RetroMags.com

- Magazines at retromags come as a series of jpg's, usually one per page but no always!

- Extract the magazine and look through each page.

- Ensure each page is uniformly sized to every other page! Magazines are like this in the real world! If some are not, follow this handy subsection:

	Cropping multi-paged images

	===

	- ensure "brew install imagemagick" is installed.

	- source the image which represents several pages and run the following:

	- convert -crop 50%X100% +repage [source.jpg] [dest.jpg]

	- In the above "50%x100%" says to divide virtually by 50% and horizontally by 100% (no crop). This means that I had two pages together. Adjust accordingly. Drag file names onto the terminal window.

	- Sometimes magazine's included bonus content, change these file names so that they appear JUST BEFORE the final cover. That way the final cover can be shown as a single page.

- Rename the pdf file to the volume number for the issue (eg 1.pdf for nintendo power volume one)

- Open FlowPaper Desktop Publisher. DOn't know what this is? You paid $95 for a license! Don't forget that. Search your emails for a serial if you don't have it installed.

- Import the pdf file.

- When asked for a template. Select "Saved Style Templates". There should be one called "retrogamemags"

- If you do not have this template. No problem. I included it in the /tools directort of this project. Simply drop the template into the location where FlowPaper is installed (/Documents/FlowPaper i think)

- You might need to adjust some settings on the left. I had to select "All Pages" and make the page turn type "3D Curved". I guess not everthing is saved to the template.flow

- If successful, the "splitting" dialog will show.

	Set the Table of Contents

	===

	- open the magazine until you find its TOC, note the page number

	- select the TOC tab

	- click the + button

	- use "Table of Contents" for the header and select the page

	- done!


- ensure navagation is working properly. does the final page number match the toolbar nav? It needs to be correct since from the table of contents you can enter a destination. The pages must match!!!

- click publish

- enter the domain "dl.dropboxusercontent.com". This is so that you can host from dropbox. This might change later!
